# Stock Price Checker

Made from freeCodeCamp.org's boilerplate for the Stock Price Checker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/stock-price-checker

You can choose port (write PORT=*your port here*) and allow testing on startup (write NODE_ENV=test) through environment variables.

You'll need to add a valid MongoDB URI string as the DB variable in the environment variables for it to work.
